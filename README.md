## About

Small software companies rely heavily on open source software, but often don't have the resources to dedicate an engineer towards fixing road blocks that come up in the projects thay use. Open source developers are often searching for projects to contribute to while also looking for ways to support their work. 

Enter Floss.

Small companies could pull Github issues into the platform, posting them with a financial reward for closing the issue. The developer who closes the issue could then claim the reward. The company that posted the issue will then confirm the claim, using the git history to verify that the developer did close the issue. The reward could be far cheaper than it costs for the company to employ resources into fixing, but enough to incentivize open source developers to tackle multiple of them to sustain their own work.

Floss. For that issue you know should be fixed, but don't want to put aside the resources into fixing.
