## About

Small software companies rely heavily on open source software, but often don't have the resources to dedicate an engineer towards fixing road blocks that come up in the projects thay use. Open source developers are often searching for projects to contribute to while also looking for ways to support their work. 

Enter Floss.

Small companies could pull Github issues into the platform, posting them with a financial reward for closing the issue. The developer who closes the issue could then claim the reward. The company that posted the issue will then confirm the claim, using the git history to verify that the developer did close the issue. The reward could be far cheaper than it costs for the company to employ resources into fixing, but enough to incentivize open source developers to tackle multiple of them to sustain their own work.

Floss. For that issue you know should be fixed, but don't want to put aside the resources into fixing.

## How It Works

Users log in using their Github account. If the user is in an organization, they could go to their organization dashboard and create a Floss posting. A posting requires a Github issue and a designating a reward amount. Then, users on the platform as open source developers could go on to check out what postings are open. The developer is then free to go resolve the issue at their own time. Once the issue is closed, the developer could claim the posting. The organization then either confirms the payment or sends a report specifying why they want to refute it. Once confirmed, the payment is then sent from the organization account to the developer's account. Floss takes no cut from the transaction.
