# About Floss

Everyone heavily relies on open source software. But, they often aren't willing to dedicate resources towards fixing road blocks that come up in the libraries thay use.

Enter Floss.

Clients could fund open source initiatives by creating Github Contracts. The work we handle for our clients could be anything as long as the end result is open source. Stuck on a Github Issue for an npm package you're using? We could fix it for you. Have an idea for a sweet new public tool? We could build it for you. The possibilities are endless as long as we could ensure that the output is open for everyone.

Floss. For that issue you know should be fixed, but don't want to put aside the resources into fixing.
